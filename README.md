I just stumbled out of the theater and, honestly, Den of Thieves: Pantera left me in a weird funk. So here I am trying to sort out my scrambled brain, not sure if I should laugh or shake my head. First off, can we talk about that car chase scene with more explosions than a fire𝘤𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘬er stand on the Fourth of July? I mean, it was the kind of chaos that either gets your blood pumping or just makes you reach for the aspirin. Not sure which camp I’m in yet.

The characters — oh boy, where do I even start? On one hand, they’re like those superhero types in a comic book (but not the cool kind, more like those off-brand versions you’d see in a discount bin). I mean the lead dude? He’s basically got that look that says, “I’m too cool to care, even though I really just look constipated.” Do these guys ever smile? Surely, they could tickle each other mid-heist, just for giggles. But then again, the baddies, they’re as cliché as ever, because of course, insert generic villain dialogue here. I felt like I could have 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥ed the character script from a 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦 website — it's that predictable.

> And let’s not forget the plot. If the storyline was a piece of abstract art, it wouldn’t be one of those meaningful ones. It would be the kind a smug toddler paints with spaghetti. There I was, fingers crossed for some twist that’d blow my socks off — but nope. Just a meh “I saw that coming” vibe instead. They’ve mixed ten different genres and ended up with a casserole that leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Maybe that’s why I can’t quite decide if I want to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   later or just put a pin in the whole affair.

Then there’s this odd soundtrack business. It’s like the composer was trying to mix classical with dubstep while blindfolded. Every time the bass dropped, all I could think was, “Is the floor vibrating, or am I experiencing an earthquake?” It’s pretty funny how they knew just how to hammer that fight scene intensity, even if it meant going full hammerhead.

So here I am, swaying between yelling at my friends for recommending this 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 and oddly still feeling attached to it — like a bad B   you can’t help re-𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 when you’re sick in bed. Would I 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again? Maybe if it’s raining too hard and my internet goes out, leaving me with some sketchy DVD. Not a ringing endorsement, I know, but hey, the chaos brainsplatter in this flick is something you ought to witness at least once. Or twice, if you’ve got a really high tolerance for wild B-tier cinema!
